# SmartHomeMQTT
This is a project for a software quality course at the [Technische Hochschule Mittelhessen](https://www.thm.de/site/).

---

It simulates a smart home environment where devices communicate with a common backend over MQTT.
No real sensors are used, it is just to demonstrate the control flow and as an excercise for improving software quality.
For this reason, code documentation and test coverage were a central focus point of the application.

## Additional resources
As part of the assignment, additional documentation (like UML class diagrams) had to be created.
This can be found in the project's [wiki](https://github.com/DominikDoom/SmartHomeMQTT/wiki)
